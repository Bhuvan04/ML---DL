Create new environment:


Mongo DB:
1. Table in sql called as collection in Mongo DB
2. Rows in SQL called as records/documents in Mongo DB
3. Documents has Key Value pairs.

API --> REST --> JSON

Python --> Web Applications --> Flask (Web application development framework) --> we can build gui or just the url

While deploying we need to keep the same environment, so we have created the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create file automatically:
pip freeze >requirements.txt

Adding the web scrapping file in the pivotal:
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io
cf push
