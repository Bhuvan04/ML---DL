ML libraries : Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy,  Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly,
               Bokeh (Bokeh generates visualizations in HTML and JavaScript. This allows for web-based visualizations that can have interactive features.)
DL Libraires : Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch
TensorFlow is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by Google Brain.
Keras is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries, such as TensorFlow,
    in order to program neural networks. Keras is designed for rapid development and experimentation.
PyTorch is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is known for being comparatively easy to use, 
    especially for developers already familiar with Python and a Pythonic code style.

Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine that is designed for cluster-computing and that is often used for large-scale data processing and big data.

End-to-end with Azure:
  You can analyze and train a small amount of data with your local machine using Jupyter notebook, Visual studio, or other tools. 
  But with very large amounts of data, or you need a faster processor, it's a better idea to train and test the model remotely using cloud services such as Microsoft Azure.
  You can use Azure Data Science Virtual Machine, Azure Databricks (Data analytics platform, optimized for use with Microsoft cloud services), Azure Machine Learning Compute,
  or SQL server ML services to train and test models and use Azure Kubernetes to deploy models.
