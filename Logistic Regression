Confusion Matrix: TP, FP, FN, TN
  Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN)
  Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
  Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
  F1 Score = 2∗(Precision∗Recall)/(Precision+Recall)
  
Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve = TP on Y axis & FP on X axis.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) = lies b/w 0.5 to 1 ideally. An AUC of 0.5 indicates random guessing, while an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect classification.
