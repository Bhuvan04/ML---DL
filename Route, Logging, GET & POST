Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and 
  GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body 
  which makes it more secure way of transferring data

Some other features of GET requests are: GET/RegisterDao.jsp?name1=value1&name2=value2
  It remains in the browser history
  It can be bookmarked
  It can be cached
  It have length restrictions
  It should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
  It should only be used for retrieving the data

Some other features of POST requests are:
  This requests cannot be bookmarked
  This requests have no restrictions on length of data
  This requests are never cached
  This requests do not retain in the browser history
